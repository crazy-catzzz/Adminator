# I STOPPED THE HEROKU VERSION'S DEVELOPEMENT IN FAVOR OF [THE REPL.IT VERSION](https://github.com/miao704g/new-Adminator)

# Adminator
Private admin bot for a Discord server

# How to use
This bot is hosted on Heroku so you may want to follow [the idiot's guide](https://anidiots.guide/hosting/heroku) unless you already know how to use Heroku

Also make sure to disable the web dyno and to enable the service one otherwise it won't start
